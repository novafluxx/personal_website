# Lazy Loading Implementation Summary

This document outlines the changes made to the project to correctly implement lazy loading for Blazor WebAssembly, resolving the `BLAZORSDK1001` build error.

## Problem

The initial implementation of lazy loading failed because the components to be lazy-loaded (`Aviation.razor`, `Experience.razor`, `Contact.razor`) were part of the main application project. The Blazor build process requires that lazy-loaded components reside in separate Razor Class Libraries (RCLs) so they can be compiled into distinct DLLs that are fetched on demand.

## Solution

The project was restructured to support lazy loading correctly:

1.  **Created Razor Class Libraries (RCLs):**
    *   Three new RCL projects were created to house the lazy-loaded components:
        *   `personal_website.Components.Pages.Aviation`
        *   `personal_website.Components.Pages.Experience`
        *   `personal_website.Components.Pages.Contact`

2.  **Moved Components:**
    *   The `Aviation.razor`, `Experience.razor`, and `Contact.razor` files were moved from the main project's `Components/Pages` directory into their respective RCLs.

3.  **Updated Project References:**
    *   The main `personal_website.csproj` was updated to reference the three new RCLs.
    *   The `<BlazorWebAssemblyLazyLoad>` item group was removed from the `.csproj` file, as this is now handled by the project references.

4.  **Updated `App.razor`:**
    *   The `Router` component was updated to include the `AdditionalAssemblies` parameter, which is populated with the lazy-loaded assemblies.
    *   The `OnNavigateAsync` method was updated to load the correct assemblies from the new RCLs and add them to the `lazyLoadedAssemblies` list.

This restructuring aligns the project with the official Microsoft documentation for lazy loading in Blazor WebAssembly, resulting in a successful build and functional lazy loading.
